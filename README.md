I FORMULATED THE OBJECTIVES  AND THE  METHODS PLUS MODELS TO WORK WITH IN LINE OF THE TITTLE I DECIDED TO WORK WITH FROM THE DATA

MY DATA OUTLOOK WAS AS FOLLOW The data was a csv file Had 3333 rows and 21 columns, Had nonull values nor duplicates thus was clean Data, but of integers, floats and characters.

I CHECKED THE FOLLOWING ON THE DATA; null values, duplicates, and reshaped the appearence of the columns tittles.

EVENTUALLY I WAS ABLE TO COME OUT WITH THE FOLLOWING FOUNDING;Best Model: Logistic Regression is the best model among the three based on the F1-score for class 415, despite its poor performance on classes 408 and 510. Justification is that it has the highest F1-score for class 415 (0.66), which is crucial if class 415 is the primary class of interest. While it performs poorly on the other classes, the ability to perfectly recall class 415 (1.00) indicates that it can identify all instances of this class, which may be important depending on the business contex. Feature Analysis; Account length is the most important features influencing the target variable to provide actionable insights for business.t.
